# ID Field Transformation Fix

## Issue

The API backend returns MongoDB-style `_id` fields but the frontend expects `id` fields for consistency with TypeScript interfaces and template bindings.

## Solution

Modified the `BaseService` class to automatically handle `_id` ↔ `id` transformations:

### Incoming API Responses (MongoDB → Frontend)

- Automatically transforms `_id` to `id` when `_id` exists and `id` doesn't exist
- Recursively handles nested objects and arrays
- Maintains data integrity with error handling

### Outgoing API Requests (Frontend → MongoDB)

- Transforms `id` to `_id` while keeping both for maximum compatibility
- Ensures MongoDB operations work correctly
- Applies to CREATE, UPDATE, and PATCH operations

## Files Modified

- `src/app/shared/services/base.service.ts` - Added transformation logic

## Affected Services

All services extending `BaseService`:

- `BatchService` - Now properly handles batch selection in registration
- `AlumniService` - ID fields work correctly in templates
- `EventService` - Event routing and tracking work properly
- `NewsService` - News articles use correct ID format

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: Frontend code uses consistent `id` fields
2. **MongoDB Compatibility**: Backend continues to use `_id` as expected
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces remain clean with `id: string`
4. **Template Consistency**: All `track` and `[value]` bindings use `item.id`
5. **Router Links**: All `[routerLink]` directives work with proper IDs

## Example

Before (would fail):

```html
<option [value]="batch._id">{{ batch.name }}</option>
<!-- _id not available -->
```

After (works automatically):

```html
<option [value]="batch.id">{{ batch.name }}</option>
<!-- id transformed from _id -->
```

## Testing

The transformation is applied automatically to all API responses and requests. No changes needed in existing components or templates.
